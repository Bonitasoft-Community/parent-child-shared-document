An example about sharing document between parent and child instance (call activity).

##Â Compatibility
Build and tested with Bonita BPM 7.1.5 Community Edition.
Should be compatible with any later version and with Subscription edition.

Note that same solution as from parent to child can be used to achieve such use case.
